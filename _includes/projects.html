    <h3> 3D Rendering Engine </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Utilises OpenGL </li>
      <li> Provided a Grasp of 3D Graphics</li>
      <li> C++ &amp; C Knowledge </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Built a 3D Rendering Engine in OpenGL and Glut using the fixed-rendering pipeline. 
      Includes a custom-fully featured 3D Mesh loader, simple 3D collisions between multiple objects, 
      a high degree of performance and efficiency & more. Built in 3 Weeks as a project </p>

    <h3> Business Card Recognition App </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Complete Android Application </li>
      <li> Use of Google's Vision API</li>
      <li> Basic Database Use </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Created an Android Application in Android Studio. The Application primarily uses Google's Vision API to read photos of
    Business Cards, which are then run through an algorithm which extracts the relevant information and categorises it. Additionally
    the application also implements saving and loading of read business cards, as well as toasts, menus and settings. </p>

    <h3> UC Campus Map App </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Use of Google Maps API </li>
      <li> Implemented Web Activities</li>
      <li> Java Knowledge </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Created an Android Application in Android Studio to provide a map of the University of Canberra campus.
    Includes Google Maps overview of the University of Canberra Campus with full zooming and pins and highlighted areas.
    Implements Web activities within the application, allowing browsing and quick access of the University of Canberra website.
    In line with Google maps, it also provides the ability to view a street camera at select locations.
    Additionally, the app also provides the expected staples of android applications such as performance, options and toasts. </p>
